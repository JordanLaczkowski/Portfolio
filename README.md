When I created my first commit, I was still working on the links to get my URLs working.

After some help, I was able to get the URLs figured out.

Since then I have re-pushed my code. I definitely did not do enough pushing into GitHub. I need to get better at that.

Title: Jordan's Portfolio -- this is just something simple so that I can easily re-find and add to while I am continuously adding to my projects.

This will be the main place where I will update my accomplished projects and act as a Resume for my developing journey.
